# Challenge 1
The first challenge of the UCI bootcamp

## Description

-My motivation was to learn on how to create correct semantics and where I could clean up codes.

-I wanted to build this project to make a working website that had a cleaner and more concise html and css.

-It made it so that the code was correctly tagged and css wasn't as cluttered.

-I learned that I still have a long road ahead of me, but that I am enjoying the journey that I am on. 

-I did a little more than what the homeowrk wanted me to do, just so that I could learn and make sure that I understood what I was doing.
